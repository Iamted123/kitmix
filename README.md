KitMix combines the best of IKEA, Instructables, and McMaster-Carr to offer a revolutionary platform where 3D printing enthusiasts can access comprehensive DIY project kits. This solution tackles the common challenges hobbyists face, such as the overwhelming process of sourcing numerous parts for projects found on sites like Instructables and the need for specialized equipment like laser cutters, waterjets, or CNC machines.

At KitMix, users are invited to upload their own designs, incorporating specific parts from a pre-defined SolidWorks library that matches our in-stock inventory. Each user-submitted design is then made available for purchase as a complete kit. Design creators earn a 15% commission on each sale, incentivizing innovation and participation. Our team enhances the user experience by developing high-quality, IKEA-like instructions for each project.

Each kit delivered by KitMix includes these detailed instructions, necessary 3D print files, and all physical components—pre-fabricated through advanced methods like waterjet, CNC, or laser cutting—complete with all essential assembly hardware such as screws.

KitMix empowers hobbyists to easily replicate and innovate on each other’s designs with the simplicity and convenience of an IKEA kit. They can now complete projects in just a weekend or two, avoiding the lengthy delays often associated with part sourcing and equipment limitations.
